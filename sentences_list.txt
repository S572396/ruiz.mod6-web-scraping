When we think about the onward march of automotive technology, headlights aren’t usually the first thing that come to mind.
Sentence 2: Engines, fuel efficiency, and the switch to electric power are all more front of mind.
Sentence 3: However, that doesn’t mean there aren’t thousands of engineers around the world working to improve the state of the art in automotive lighting day in, day out.
Sentence 4: Sealed beam headlights gave way to more modern designs once regulations loosened up, while bulbs moved from simple halogens to xenon HIDs and, more recently, LEDs.
Sentence 5: Now, a new technology is on the scene, with lasers!
Sentence 6: Laser Headlights?!
Sentence 7: BWM’s prototype laser headlight assemblies undergoing testing.
Sentence 8: The first image brought to mind by the phrase “laser headlights” is that of laser beams firing out the front of an automobile.
Sentence 9: Obviously, coherent beams of monochromatic light would make for poor illumination outside of a very specific spot quite some distance away.
Sentence 10: Thankfully for our eyes, laser headlights don’t work in this way at all.
Sentence 11: Instead, laser headlights consist of one or more solid state laser diodes mounted inside the headlight.
Sentence 12: These blue lasers are fired at a yellow phosphor, similar to that used in white LEDs.
Sentence 13: This produces a powerful, vibrant white light that can then be bounced off reflectors and out of the headlights towards the road.
Sentence 14: Laser headlights built in this way have several benefits.
Sentence 15: They’re more energy efficient than LEDs that put out the same amount of light, while also being more space efficient, too.
Sentence 16: BWM’s futuristic i8 was one of the first vehicles to ship with laser headlight technology.
Sentence 17: Laser headlights are still a nascent technology, thus far only appearing in a few BMW, Audi, and other select vehicles.
Sentence 18: BMW’s technology was developed in partnership with lighting experts OSRAM.
Sentence 19: In practice, a regular LED low-beam lamp is used, with the laser used to create an incredibly bright and focused spot, used for high-beams.
Sentence 20: This can provide illumination out to 600 meters ahead of the vehicle, double that of conventional LED high beams.
Sentence 21: The lights use indium gallium nitride diode lasers that were originally used in projectors, with power levels above 1 watt.
Sentence 22: One of the challenges in implementing such technology in an automotive environment is the need for it to operate at temperature extremes.
Sentence 23: While research lasers and laser pointers may primarily be used at typical room temperatures, automotive headlights must be able to withstand everything from 40 degrees below zero up to 50 degrees C. Thankfully, the laser’s high efficiency means it doesn’t have huge heat output of its own to further complicate things.
Sentence 24: Other engineering challenges involve tailoring the optics package for the rough-and-tumble, high vibration environment found in the automotive application.
Sentence 25: It’s also important to ensure, as with any such device, that the end user can’t be exposed to harmful laser radiation in the event of accident or malfunction.
Sentence 26: Tearing Down the Laser Headlight
A marketing image showing the construction of an aftermarket LED/laser headlight.
Sentence 27: We’d take the laser power with a grain of salt — it’s difficult to imagine a 10 W laser shining directly on some small LEDs without melting a hole through the board in short order.
Sentence 28: An aftermarket has sprung up too, with delightfully innovative designs.
Sentence 29: Combined laser/LED headlights are readily available on Alibaba, designed as a drop in replacement for projector lamps on existing vehicles.
Sentence 30: These often use an LED low-beam, and a combined LED/laser high beam, where the laser diode shoots directly at the LED phosphor to excite it further, rather than using its own.
Sentence 31: These units often also come with fan cooling to keep the laser and LEDs below their maximum operational temperature.
Sentence 32: Such developments are exciting, though it’s important to be wary of the performance of unknown aftermarket headlights.
Sentence 33: Many aftermarket LED headlight “upgrades” fail to pass muster when it comes to real-world performance, and there’s no reason to believe hybrid LED/laser designs will be any different.
Sentence 34: We’d love to pass a selection of these parts through a full IIHS test protocol, but that’s sadly beyond the scope (and budget!)
Sentence 35: of this article.
Sentence 36: However, [mikeselectricstuff] has happened to lay his hands on both the BMW and aftermarket parts, tearing them all down in his workshop to see what makes them tick.
Sentence 37: The differences are multitude when laid bare on the bench.
Sentence 38: The AliExpress part is relatively simple, wired up no differently from a regular headlight.
Sentence 39: Interestingly, however, the laser high-beam circuit runs all the time in these parts.
Sentence 40: To prevent blinding other road users, a shutter is kept in place to block the light, which is moved out of the way with a solenoid when the driver turns on the high beam switch.
Sentence 41: Where the aftermarket part is a little out of left field, the BMW design is another thing entirely.
Sentence 42: The cutting-edge headlights are hooked up with multiple connectors and over 30 conductors, with much of the driver electronics living in an external controller.
Sentence 43: Much of this is to drive the various LEDs and stepper motors for slewing the headlights when steering.
Sentence 44: However, the laser assembly brings its own complexities.
Sentence 45: Twin light sensors are built inside to monitor the laser beam, and a special metal blocking arm sits directly in front of the diode, presumably to stop the laser light leaving the headlight in the event the phosphor coating burns through.
Sentence 46: It’s truly wild to get a look inside a modern luxury car’s headlight and see just how far we’ve come from the old days of simple sealed beams.
Sentence 47: Cost Versus Performance
Despite the efficiency gains available, the technology remains expensive.
Sentence 48: Powerful laser diodes don’t come cheap, after all.
Sentence 49: However, as the technology trickles down to lower-end models, it’s likely that we could see economies of scale change that for the better.
Sentence 50: Indeed, if national authorities begin to demand higher performance headlights as standard, we could see laser headlights become the norm, rather than an expensive luxury.
Sentence 51: The technology could naturally be applied to home and commercial lighting, too — though we suspect the potential gains are limited enough that LED lighting will remain the norm for some time to come.
Sentence 52: The high light output of laser headlights in a compact package allows engineers greater freedom when designing the front-end of a car.
Sentence 53: As it currently stands, much of the appeal of the new technology is about the packaging benefits, which allow automotive designers greater freedom around the headlight area.
Sentence 54: Such concerns are less of a factor when it comes to light fittings in the home or office, or indeed, on lower-end automobiles.
Sentence 55: Regardless, it’s an exciting new application for lasers and one we’ll be sure to see more of in the future.

As someone in my 50s, with naturally deteriorating eyesight, I am frequently dazzled by insanely bright HID or LED headlights.
Sentence 59: Laser excited phosphor headlights just sound like an tech overcomplication for up market German performance cars.
Sentence 60: Most people don’t want to, or are unlikely to ever drive at 240km/h at night on a German autobahn.
Sentence 61: Light emissions from these vehicles can be just as offensive as their tail-pipe emissions.
Sentence 62: If the designers are bored and want to put more tech into vehicles just for the sake of it, they might consider an infrared floodlight and an IR camera connected to a head-up-display.
Sentence 63: If you need to see 600m ahead of you in the dark – you are probably driving too fast.

To be complete, these laser headlamps comes with a, intelligent driver that enable laser only under conditions (speed, steering wheel, no other car crossing).
Sentence 65: But in my own opinion, with these restrictions you can see at 600m when… there’s nothing to see.

I’m… just trying to parse this.
Sentence 68: You really think there’s no point to having vision out to 600 m (30 seconds at 70 kph) at night when there are no other cars on the road?
Sentence 69: There are things on roads other than cars, you know.
Sentence 70: A hard brake at 70 kph will take ~15 second to come to a stop, and carries a *big* risk if you’re the lead car with someone behind you.
Sentence 71: This basically *doubles* the visibility distance.
Sentence 72: I mean, yes, they’re a problem for oncoming traffic and drivers in front of you.

I don’t think so.
Sentence 76: An average car can do a hard stop within 70 meters from 70 kph (19.5 m/s) and that’s giving you two seconds of reaction time.
Sentence 77: Assuming linear deceleration, your average stopping time will be between 7-8 seconds.
Sentence 78: If you take twice that time, your brakes are shot.
Sentence 79: Second point is, assuming average eyesight, the smallest distinct object you can just about make out from 600 meters away would be the size of a football, if it has enough contrast with the background, but that would require daylight levels of illumination, and no vibration and shaking from the vehicle.
Sentence 80: In the dark, no matter how bright your headlights are, you would be lucky to make out an object the size of a truck at that distance.
Sentence 81: It’s just gonna be a blur.

“Assuming linear deceleration, your average stopping time will be between 7-8 seconds.
Sentence 85: If you take twice that time, your brakes are shot.”
Sentence 86: Unless the road’s wet, in which case the general estimate is a factor of two increase in stopping distance, which hey, gets you to around that 15 second mark (okay, maybe 12-13 seconds, I did put an ‘approximate’ there).
Sentence 87: You don’t design safety for the *best* conditions.
Sentence 88: Should’ve clarified that better, though.
Sentence 89: “Second point is, assuming average eyesight, the smallest distinct object you can just about make out from 600 meters away would be the size of a football”
… I’m sorry, do you generally worry about hitting footballs on the road?
Sentence 90: I’m pretty sure the main things I worry about on roads (deer, vehicles, trees) are *way* bigger than footballs.
Sentence 91: Besides, the main point isn’t seeing things at 600 m. It’s seeing things farther than ~200 m away, which is where normal high beams cut out.

actually… lowering light concentrations increases the visibility for everyone.
Sentence 101: bright lights reduce visibility for everyone for up to 20 minutes (the amount of time it takes your eyes to adjust)
because eyeballs actually take time to fully adjust to a dark environment.
Sentence 102: vis-a-vie, when you flick a light switch off, you can’t see shit, but if you sit in that dark room for 20 minutes you’ll be able to see everything provided you don’t have poor eyesight.
Sentence 103: bright lights are for dip shits that don’t understand the basic principles of how their own eyesight works.
Sentence 104: there should be a small tax on the sale of every vehicle that goes toward adding a diffused ambient light to all major roadways so that way headlights are not even required.
Sentence 105: and yes, diffused so that way the lights are not contributing to light pollution, and yes, we do have the technology (and it’s cheap) to create lighting in such a way.
Sentence 106: it’s appalling how many people (even here) don’t understand these basic principles.
Sentence 107: bright headlights are dumb.
Sentence 108: focused headlights are even worse.
Sentence 109: BMW’s headlights are garbage even though they have those ‘mitigating’ features, they still end up blinding you constantly.
Sentence 110: They have had multiple iterations trying to do the same thing.
Sentence 111: this comes from someone who worked at their manufacturing facilities.
Sentence 112: those headlights are a giant pile of irritating garbage and you will get my brights turned on every time i see them, because they don’t adjust properly or fast enough.
Sentence 113: it’s always too late, the tech literally doesn’t work well enough and they’re blowing a ton of money on learning how to properly blind the crap out of everyone on the road… but you can’t tell a german that they are wrong and their attempt to over engineer their way out of a problem is dumb… believe me, it’s a lost cause.

When riding outside the city, I found I needed 2 lights, one angled down to see potholes, roadkill, etc in time, the other angled up to be bright enough not to get hit or get my retinas fried constantly with the high beams.
Sentence 119: You get that problem with car reversing lights also, some are just all brightness directed out parallel to the ground so other cars see you reversing, some actually provide illumination so you can see to reverse at night.
Sentence 120: The first type, you have to ride or tap your brakes all the time to dispel the inky blackness with the brake lights.

It would be great if they worked.
Sentence 130: So far the largest problem is that the lamps are bright enough that sufficient light is reflected down from the windshield to the dash and back to the windshield to leave very low contrast ahead of me from cars behind me.
Sentence 131: And they are always shown on desert-flat roads, without any consideration for cresting hills.
Sentence 132: But it’s great that you are working on this because the razor edge cut-off that drives 0% to 100% to 0% to 100% due to slight bumps in the road that wipe out all my night vision are really appreciated.

Mike,  being America, politics tends to spoil legislation.
Sentence 141: The DOT  has lagged behind for decades, not because they’re dullards but from states having political bearing on lighting standards for vehicles.
Sentence 142: Finally, when round sealed beams went away as hood lines were lowered giving manufacturers more room to design custom headlights, we’re now flooded with halogen, hid, led and laser headlights.

The arm is fixed, and is almost certainly hefty enough to absorb 1-10w if laser energy without heating up all that much, so no burn through.
Sentence 174: Also, there’s no misalignment if the the laser housing is placed in a premachined or cast part with no option for adjusting the alignment.
Sentence 175: So basically as is designed, if the phosphor coating is destroyed and the arm isn’t a mirror, then all that happens is the lasert light gets scattered around the headlight interior and at best some leaks out but due to light spreading out, unless you where right up on the spot where the phosphor was you wouldn’t get enough laser energy hitting your eye to do any damage.

With the vibrations, poor maintenance and how little laser energy it needs to damage the eye I’d say there is a very real danger still.
Sentence 178: If you can be 100% certain the heatsinking and orientation of the this blocking arm you are not putting it in a car in the real world, where the sudden shock of hitting a pot hole or curb and the generally harsh environment with constant vibrations of a bad road has broken things its not supposed to be able to many many times now…
I’m sure its perfectly safe as a technology in the lab, will be fine in cars for a while, but at some point the housing will crack/bend, the arm will corrode, water can ingress etc etc, and being an invisible problem there will be stray lasers that can cause serious eye damage out there, because nobody noticed the failure yet (when its throwing dazzingly bright light hundreds of meters by design even shedding a sizeable percentage won’t be obvious to the driver much of the time, and cracked parts or water inside are not always visible without complete disassembly and possibly x-rays either)

Sentence 188: Effective and safe automotive illumination was a solved problem 30 years ago, and most subsequent ‘improvements’ represent a triumph of style over substance.
Sentence 189: Even a lot of LED lighting is a distracting and annoying nuisance, except in those instances where the PWM frequency is high enough where my eyes see only a faint flicker instead of the illusion that the lights are jumping around in mid-air.

This does really worry me.
Sentence 201: I already have problems with many HID headlights that are from such a focused beam of light that they are piercing at night and nearly blind me with oncoming traffic.
Sentence 202: This is only going to make it worse.
Sentence 203: We need much more diffuse light, not more concentrated light.
Sentence 204: Use LEDs across the entire front of the car – that will give much more light but also more diffuse so that it’s not going to kill my night vision every time I drive by one.

Why should one use UV when intense blue light is available?

Also if they are bright enough to let you from the reflected light see half a Km or more, they are going to be dazzling to the poor sap in the oncoming lane probably out to two Km or so, where you won’t be able to see them with their sane ‘normal’  stupidly bright modern headlight levels of lighting, as your eyes are so swamped by the brighter still local lighting…

Not to discount the concern, since misuse or lack of maintenance is a definite concern, but as a reference point, a 2018 Subaru with LED steering-responsive headlights (that also aim lower when they detect the car is heavily loaded in the rear) has high beams that automatically dim when another car is seen.

Today they are for high beams.
Sentence 278: Then it will be for “safety” that it is transitioned to low beams.
Sentence 279: Recall that the SAE standards for low-beams assumed that the maximum illumination would be in the central area aligned with the filament, with fall-off to the edges to avoid a sharp transition, and then lamp makers used optics to drive the maximum allowable illumination to 100% of the field with no gradual drop-off, creating that blinding flash transition so popular today.
Sentence 280: Of course they also did that test with the mandated 12V supply even though autos run theirs at 14-15V, for a gain of around 20-40% in brightness over the test condition.
Sentence 281: At least with LEDs that lie no longer works, but the elimination of gradual falloff more than makes up.

I think that kind of depends on the cars and driver behaviour round your way… If they are as out to kill you as the cars round here, with the same headlight intensity and manners as many drivers show me as a cyclist you might well both want and need a brighter bike light to make up for being so dazzled all the time your eyes are in full noonday sun daylight mode….
Sentence 310: Always kept 2 lights on my bike for “night” riding, the usual pretty dull “please don’t crash into me” light, bright enough to ride by but doesn’t throw a great distance, and the rather potent one to toggle on every time you end up blinded by the stupendously bright full beams of some arse at a really bad time, or somebody isn’t paying attention and fails to spot the rather large man, in reflective clothing, with lights… and so needs that extra kick to actually stick to their bloody side of the road – amazing how if you suddenly look bright and dazzling enough to be a car or motorbike they care… Much as I enjoyed the cycling part I really don’t miss commuting that way at all…

No.

Sentence 348: Then there is the overall luminous efficacy and efficiency of the source:

“The main difference between the luminous efficacy of radiation and the luminous efficacy of a source is that the latter accounts for input energy that is lost as heat or otherwise”
“The following table lists luminous efficacy of a source and efficiency for various light sources”
“Theoretical limit for a white LED with phosphorescence color mixing 260–300 lm/W 38.1–43.9%”

Of course here as well, the ideal 555 nm source is by definition 100% efficient.
Sentence 351: It converts energy perfectly to photons and produces light that is perceived the brightest.
Sentence 352: A “perfect white” source with no source losses and a color temperature of 5800 K, basically a black body spectrum truncated to the perceivable colors, would have an overall luminous efficiency of 37%.
Sentence 353: This improves as you make the spectrum narrower.
Sentence 354: Likewise, LED lights are able to overcome this only by compromising on the light quality with a CRI less than 100.
Sentence 355: If you have a white LED with a claimed luminous efficiency of 75%, I have some news for you: either they’re lying, or it’s nowhere near white.

Or to make it absolutely clear: 
An ideal white LED with 100% source efficiency from electricity to radiation is 38.1–43.9% efficient in terms of visible light.
Sentence 357: All real world LEDs are much worse than this^, with typical source efficiencies in the 20-30% range, which drops the practical luminous efficiency down from the theoretical max 300 lm/W to around 75-100 lm/W and the overall luminous efficiency becomes 10-15%
^(due to: heat effects, ballast losses, light losses in the LED casing, reflector and diffuser losses…)

Wonders if adding a selectable filter to stop blue laser light might make it somewhat more useful.
Sentence 370: Also using more than one emitter material ie warm and cool white, but that would be overcomplicated.
Sentence 371: I did come up with a variant using RGB LDs with a PS3 beam combiner and it should work but am lacking
a spare working >
Sentence 372: 15mW blue PL450 LD the same as the unit here.
Sentence 373: Plan is to have a beam scanner
Sentence 374: so each side scans half the road with an eye-safe divergent beam,
doubling as an indicator and other functions.
Sentence 375: User configured brightness depending on ambient light level and selective blanking so it turns off/dims
when scanning a large approaching object with its own light source(s).

A friend of mine who did rally car racing with his subaru once told me that you shouldnt mix the color temperatures of your lights too much, with the exception of yellow fog lights being effective for snow situations.
Sentence 377: The convo came up because he was replacing his headlight bulbs to match the color temperature of his new lightbar.
Sentence 378: I don’t remember his explanation of why it was important to try to match color temperatures, but it made sense at the time.
Sentence 379: Being able to change color temperatures on the fly sounds like a great idea though, and relatively easy to implement – there are definitely situations where warm white is advantageous (bad weather driving, seeing detail of snow covered roads) and other situations where cool white offers more performance (lets your eyes see further assuming clear skies.
Sentence 380: Ive also heard the really high color temperatures can reduce eye fatigue).

By the way fellow old geezers (anyone over 40 really) not that there isn’t merit in the complaints about overly bright or misaligned headlights, but there’s a way to “hack your eyes” now, in case you missed this…

Instead of a laser and its inherent risk, use an electron beam to excite the phosphor.
Sentence 383: All you need is an electron gun and an electromagnetic focusing ring and some high voltage to attract the electrons and put it in a vacuum and use some lenses to project the light.
Sentence 384: Very old tech made new and much safer than lasers.

Vacuum, heated cathodes, high voltage – are there more ways to bring efficiency down?
Sentence 387: I don’t think so.
Sentence 388: Ah yes, I forgot the extra power for the electromagnet for focusing.
Sentence 389: We want light, not waste heat!

A comment if I may, I am visually impaired, considered legally blind and even
regular headlights hurt.
Sentence 391: I don’t drive but as a passenger, someimes it seems like
I’m looking at the sun when headlights hit my eyes.
Sentence 392: Couple this with a recent
retina detachment (fixed) and a cataract (yet to be fixed), and these bright
lights are just torture.
Sentence 393: I will say that bicycle lighting has improved since
the days of the little dynamo powered flashlight bulb that was meant for
drivers to see you instead of you lighting up the road in front of you.
Sentence 394: https://youtu.be/9MAkl8tEsnA
How about low power bulbs coupled with a winshield that amplifies the ambient light
while blocking direct light?

Think about optics: A windshield that works as light amplifier is no solution, it would only blind you with glare.
Sentence 396: You would need an image intensifier, like a night vision device.
Sentence 397: And that is not possible as a windshield.

I “upgraded” my SUVs headlights from halogen bulbs with reflector housing to LED projectors (the mid-generation refresh of my car included projector headlights and LED tail lights, so my “upgrade” was OEM.
Sentence 399: I absolutely hated the cut-off line and switched back to good old reflector housings.
Sentence 400: Because my SUV is tall to begin with and lifted 2″, I had to angle the beam path down to not blind cars when I pulled up behind them at a red light.
Sentence 401: This killed the my down road range, making everything close to me brightly illuminated but the stuff down the road that I needed to see was completely black.
Sentence 402: I dont see why everyone is so fascinated with focusing light in such a way that results in sharp cut-off regions.
Sentence 403: I see it with flashlights and headlamps too.
Sentence 404: Turn the intensity down and stick with a more natural distribution of the light!

Normally you should adjust low beam lights for a 40m range.
Sentence 406: Even if your car is 5cm higher, that would only be a tiny difference in angle and the range has to stay the same.

No one forced you to lift your suv that resulted in blinding the driver in front of you at stops.
Sentence 408: You have no one to blame for lowering your new hid lights so you wouldn’t blind the driver at stops.
Sentence 409: While well intentioned and being courteous, the lift may be more harm than good.
Sentence 410: As you may or may not know,  hid projector headlights are designed with a cutoff plate inside to cut off the upper beam in a low beam projector otherwise it becomes a high beam to blind everyone.
Sentence 411: You don’t have to believe me.
Sentence 412: Do your research on hid projector lighting.
Sentence 413: Some euro vehicles have this cutoff plate on a solenoid, effectively allowing the low beam to become a high beam when the cutoff plate is moved out of the way.

More likely that people here will do what I will do, take the lasers out and make them into something new, mini laser cutter perhaps?
Sentence 417: 10W is certainly enough to cut plastic film and engrave wood.
Sentence 418: No doubt, if they become popular, companies will make more powerful laser headlights as time goes on.
Sentence 419: Perhaps we could take the phosphore and paint it onto a screen, add some galvanometers and turn it into a laser display.
Sentence 420: With new technology, comes new hacks.

No it doesn’t.

From 60km/h down to 0 is about 1,4G deceleration.
Sentence 425: Quite extreme, but nothing for the airbags to deploy.

Sealed beam halogen are far superior to HID+projectors.

I’ve often wondered whether polarisation would prevent a lot of these problems.
Sentence 429: e.g. make windshields vertically polarised for light  (like Polaroid sunglasses) and then make headlights horizontally polarised.
